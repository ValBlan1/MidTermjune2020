Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.It is a way of storing and organizing information in a computer

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Insertion: to add items to it
   Deletion: to remove items from it
   Modification: to modify items
   Searching: to search for a particular item
   Sorting: to sort the items in a required order
   Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Map, HashMap.


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler Design
   Operating System
   Database Management System
   Statistical analysis package
   Numerical Analysis
   Graphics
   Artificial Intelligence
   Simulation

what is an Array?
A. is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array members are accessed using [], ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them
what is LinkedList?
A. linear data structure and each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Array is an index based data structure and Linked list is a data structure that uses references.

what is queue?
A. the first item inserted is the first to be removed.

what is stack?
A. the last item inserted is the first to be removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO: First in First out.
   LIFO: Last in First out.

what is the order of complexity?
A.Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till
  its completion

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Linear search.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. Binary Search.

what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is actually an instance of a more general category called a graph.

what is graph in data structure?
A. Graphs are data structures used in different ways and often have a shape dictated by a physical or abstract problem.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashTable: is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads
   HashMap: is non synchronized. and it is faster than HashTable.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
A. RDBMS = Array
   Network data model = Graph
   Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap data structure is based on the principle of hashing and the  function or algorithm or method which when
   applied on any object/variable returns an unique integer value representing that object/variable.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. is a Runtime Exception thrown only at runtime, occurs whenever we are trying to access any item
   of an array at an index which is not present in the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.  *Manually.
    *Arrays.copyOf()
    *System.arraycopy()
    *Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Accessing an element in an array is fast, while Linked list takes linear
   time is slower.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. DFS: Depth First Search is a edge based technique that uses the stack structure.
   BFS: Breadth First Search

What is Recursion?
A.The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear: Data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
   Non Linear: involves multiple levels.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. it is how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, it’s useful to have a
   shorthand way to say how efficient a computer algorithm is.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.                   Best	Average	Worst
    Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
    Bubble Sort	    Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
    Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
    Heap Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
    Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
    Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
    Bucket Sort	    Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)
    Radix Sort	   Ω(nk)	θ(nk)	O(nk)



Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
